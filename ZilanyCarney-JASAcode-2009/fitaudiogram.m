function [Cohc,Cihc,OHC_Loss]=fitaudiogram(FREQUENCIES,dBLoss,Dsd_OHC_Loss)

% FITAUDIOGRAM Gives values of Cohc and Cihc that produce a desired
% threshold shift for the cat auditory-periphery model of Zilany et al.
% (J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 2009).
%
% [Cohc,Cihc,OHC_Loss]=fitaudiogram(FREQUENCIES,dBLoss,Dsd_OHC_Loss)\
%
% The output variables are arrays with values corresponding to each
% frequency in the input array FREQUENCIES.
%
% Cohc is the outer hair cell (OHC) impairment factor; a value of 1
%      corresponds to normal OHC function and a value of 0 corresponds to
%      total impairment of the OHCs.
%
% Cihc is the inner hair cell (IHC) impairment factor; a value of 1
%      corresponds to normal IHC function and a value of 0 corresponds to
%      total impairment of the IHC.
%
% OHC_Loss is the threshold shift in dB that is attributed to OHC
%      impairment (the remainder is produced by IHC impairment).
%
%
% FREQUENCIES is an array of frequencies in Hz for which you have audiogram data.
%
% dBLoss is an array of threshold shifts in dB (for each frequency in FREQUENCIES).
%
% Dsd_OHC_Loss is an optional array giving the desired threshold shift in
%      dB that is caused by the OHC impairment alone (for each frequency
%      in FREQUENCIES).
%      If this array is not given, then the default desired threshold shift
%      due to OHC impairment is 2/3 of the entire threshold shift at each
%      frequency.  This default is consistent with the effects of acoustic
%      trauma in cats (see Bruce et al., JASA 2003, and Zilany and Bruce,
%      JASA 2007) and estimated OHC impairment in humans (see Moore,
%      Glasberg & Vickers, JASA 1999).
